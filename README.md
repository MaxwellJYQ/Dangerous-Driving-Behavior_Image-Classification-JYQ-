# Dangerous Driving Behavior Image Classification (efficientnet+resnet+tranformer Hybrid Model)

## Project Introduction

The goal of this project is to perform image classification to detect and recognize dangerous driving behaviors using deep learning techniques. The project leverages a hybrid model integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Reinforcement Learning, and Transfer Learning (efficient+resnet+transfoemer hybrid model) to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the classification.
